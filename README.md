# GNOME shell extension Bing Wallpaper Changer

Let this simple GNOME shell extension change your wallpaper every day to
Microsoft Bing's wallpaper (the image you see when you visit Bing.com). It will
also show a notification containing the title and the explanation of the image.

*Disclaimer*: this extension is unofficial and not affiliated with Bing or
Microsoft in any way. Images are protected by copyright. And are licensed only
for use as wallpapers.

This extension is based extensively on the NASA APOD extension by Elinvention 
(see https://github.com/Elinvention) and Bing Desktop Wallpaper Changer by
Utkarsh Gupta (see https://github.com/UtkarshGpta).

This is my first attempt at a Gnome extension, so it may have some issues.
