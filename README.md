# GNOME Shell extension - Google Earth Wallpaper

Lightweight GNOME shell extension to set your wallpaper to a random curated Google Earth photo. It will
also show a notification containing the title and the explanation of the image.

*Disclaimer*: this extension is unofficial and not affiliated with Google in any way. Images are protected by copyright, and are licensed only
for use as wallpapers.

This extension is derived from my [Bing Wallpaper](https://github.com/neffo/bing-wallpaper-gnome-extension) GNOME extension, which was based extensively on the NASA APOD extension by [Elinvention](https://github.com/Elinvention).

## Features

* Fetches a random Google Earth wallpaper and sets as both lock screen and desktop wallpaper
* User selectable refresh intervals

## Requirements

Gnome 3.18+ (Ubuntu Gnome 16.04+, Fedora 23+)

## Install

[Install from extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1262/bing-wallpaper-changer/)

or install directly to your GNOME extensions directory (useful if you want to hack on it)

`git clone https://github.com/neffo/earth-view-wallpaper-gnome-extension.git $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/GoogleEarthWallpaper@ineffable-gmail.com`

Or, here is a suitable [zip file] I prepared earlier.
